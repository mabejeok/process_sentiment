customers across Southeast Asia, optimize our supply chain and orchestrate
customer communications.

  

We believe in enabling our engineers in working across the stack to solve
interesting problems and keep work exciting. Depending on personal interests
and previous experience, you could pair up with a data engineer to deploy a
feature store, write a streaming data pipeline or deploy new infrastructure
with Terraform for example. You can share ideas and learn from your teammates
during our weekly huddles or architecture design sessions.

  

Responsibilities

  * Train and deploy machine learning models, with emphasis on deep learning and recommendations
  * Further develop our ML platform and training/ serving orchestration (MLFlow + Kubernetes)
  * Contribute to and enhance data models and shared feature sets for machine learning development (DBT + BigQuery)
  * Drive best practices for testing and deployment in the context of machine learning products

  

Requirements

  * Good understanding of deep learning in general, proficiency with either Tensorflow or PyTorch
  * Experience with one or more general purpose programming languages (Python, Java or Go for example)
  * Excellent knowledge of SQL and columnar DBs

omnichannel retailer in South East Asia. As part of LVMH,
(www.lvmh.com/group), we provide an unparalleled combination of resources,
scale, and autonomy to our employees.

  

Sephora SEA was created through the combination of the Sephora's retail
business in South East Asia and Luxola, a Singaporean start-up that broke new
frontiers in ecommerce regionally. We proudly maintain an entrepreneurial and
technology-focused culture, with all our capabilities built in-house – a
rarity in this region.

  

The data is definitive: diversity leads to better teams, better performance,
and better results. Consequently, we actively seek to hire employees of all
genders, backgrounds, and experiences. We provide our employees with a unique
opportunity to take on senior responsibilities, accelerate their career path,

**About Syngenta:**

Syngenta is a leading agriculture company (revenue over 13.5 billion dollars)
helping to improve global food security by enabling millions of farmers to
make better use of available resources.

Through world class science and innovative crop solutions, their 28,000 people
in over 90 countries are working to transform how crops are grown.

Syngenta is a business that helps humanity face its toughest challenge: how to
feed a rising population, sustainably. ‘

At the heart of their contribution is The Good Growth Plan, their six
commitments to address critical challenges the world faces to achieve food
security. Their business – and the world’s food security – depend on
sustainable natural resources, healthy ecosystems and thriving rural
communities. Which is why they cooperate with industry partners, governments
and NGOs to support the achievement of the United Nations’ Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs).

Their innovations help farmers to overcome multiple challenges – from weeds,
insects and disease, to the effects of heat and cold on crops. Whether they
grow corn or rice, vegetables or coffee, farmers around the world trust
Syngenta to help them produce healthy, premium crops and minimize the use of
precious natural resources

  * Substantial subsidies and programs to keep that creative flow while having fun (Health promotion program, annual overseas company outing, an annual dinner that nobody will ever forget, etc.)
  * Hardcore work and hardcore fun!

Working at Titansoft will probably be unlike any other careers you have ever
had.

team. This includes the addition of several data scientists.

  

As a data scientist you are expected to help formulate clear problem
definitions, work on proof of concepts to prove the feasibility of the
proposed approaches and maintain and improve our current models in production.
Additionally, by suggesting and implementing metrics to be tracked you will
help us with building out our analytics capabilities. As such, a good
foundation in mathematics and statistics is expected. Expect to work on a
broad scope of data science related problems, varying from regression to
mathematical optimisation, so any experience in such topics is appreciated.
However, don’t be deterred, what we value most is willingness to learn and the
persistence to work through challenging problems.

 **Requirements**

Job requirements

  * A bachelor's or master’s degree and 0-2 years of experience with a good foundation in mathematics and statistics (e.g. business analytics, mathematics, statistics, theoretical sciences, computer science or similar)
  * Demonstrable knowledge of at least one programming language, and a willingness to learn more. We don’t work in a particular language but expect to interact with Kotlin, TypeScript, Python and some R.

Dyson IT  
At Dyson, we demand the highest standard of performance from the technologies
we engineer. Our people expect the same from the technology that supports
them. We are a community that appreciates and advocates better engineering. A
community of pioneers.  
Our Data team  
This role sits within Dyson's Global Data Services team. This team is tasked
with ensuring that the various parts of Dyson's business are able to leverage
rich, accurate, and timely data to generate insights and make better
decisions. As a part of IT, the team has the resources and the remit to keep
up with Dyson's impressive global growth.  
Building our analytical capabilities is a core pillar of Dyson's new global
data strategy. As more consumers engage with Dyson, via more types of
products, and across more markets, the volume and diversity of data will
greatly increase. Understanding how to use this data to improve everything
from customer experiences to product development will be key to Dyson's
success.
